# Echoes of the Abyss 🧙‍♀️🕯️

**Echoes of the Abyss** is an atmospheric 2D educational platformer built in Unity 2022. Designed specifically for **EFL (English as a Foreign Language)** learners, it blends gothic exploration with linguistic mastery.

## 📖 The Storyboard: A Manor of Forgotten Words
You awake in the heart of the **Abyssal Manor**, a sprawling, shifting estate where the very walls whisper in a language you can no longer grasp. You are a Mage of great power, but your mind is a void—your memories have been shattered into "Echoes."

The manor is a living puzzle. To regain your identity and escape, you must navigate treacherous 2D labyrinths. However, your path is frequently barred by **Grammatical Seals**. These are not typical locks; they are linguistic trials that require you to reconstruct your knowledge of the English language to proceed.

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics
The game balances traditional platforming with "Educational Gatekeeping":

* **The Labyrinth Trials:** Each section of the manor is a mini-labyrinth. Reaching the end of a corridor brings you to a Seal.
* **The MCQ Seals:** To unlock a door or bridge a gap, you must interact with a "Memory Altar." This triggers an EFL challenge.
* **Visual Feedback:** Correct answers restore light and color to the room, while incorrect answers keep the path shrouded in shadow, forcing the player to reconsider their choice.
* **Memory Recovery:** Every successful lock opened restores a fragment of the story, giving the player a narrative reward for their grammatical accuracy.

## 📚 Educational Impact
*Echoes of the Abyss* moves beyond worksheets by placing grammar in a high-stakes fantasy context:
* **Mastering Prepositions:** Specifically targets prepositions of place and time (in, on, at, behind, through).
* **Grammar in Action:** Focuses on Tense Consistency and Sentence Structure through contextual MCQ prompts.
* **Accessible Learning:** Simple controls ensure that students focus 10% on the platforming and 90% on language processing.
